# Symfony: Requiem
This lil' project is a learning challenge.
And the challenge's name is: Symfony.
So I will not focus on finishing everything in time, my main priority will be learning.

The only Symfony I have ever known is in music, and even then my knowledge of it is very limited.
These are the goals that have been set by our coaches for this assignment:

* Install Symfony
* Learn about the lifecycle of software
* Learn to use the MVC layer of Symfony
* Learn to use the routing component
* Learn the basics of twig

## Installing Symfony
The installing process should've been an easy one. **It should've**. 
But I did end up with some minor problems.
For reasons still unknown to me, my GitBash terminal couldn't access my PHP.
Commands like <code>php -v</code> and the like did work in the terminal, but once I tried the <code>symfony new my_project_directory --version="6.1.*" --webapp</code>, it gave me an error saying that the no PHP binaries were detected.

The issue was fixed the moment I started using the Command Prompt tho, so that's nice.

I thought it was funny that I had to use the Windows Powershell to install Scoop so I could install Symfony.
So I made a meme about it, because of course I did.
